                        picking up a new (but really old) software in 2025 always feels taunting, especially when your laziness can't depend on an AI chat assistant to guide you through the difficulties of a new UI environment. I've known of Blender for years now. From a distance, it was always something that I would just lend my respect towards, even more so to the souls that could decipher it’s uses. For this training-wheels period, I took on modeling music notes from the circle of fifths chart that lives pasted at the top of my workspace in the living room of my KTown kingdom.

                        Ideation was simple. I make music and do all my design projects from the same standings desk, so I tend to mix the two mediums at any given opportunity. Truthfully, I felt like at this point in my 3d career, music notes wouldn’t have me pulling my hair out– a sight my lovely roommates wouldn’t want to see. I present the beauty of a half note, a quarter note, and an eighth note.

                        To construct this masterpiece, I relied heavily on the use of UV spheres and a single square, for the eighth note’s flag. After making the quarter note first to establish a template, i was able to have a foundation for the rest of the notes construction– even hollowing out the center of the half note!

                        To be honest, the joy in coloring, adding light, and the floor/background provided me enough pleasure to want to come back to this software. Usually with things like this, i try to look for specs of satisfaction that i can strive to fulfill on each go – i’m fully aware this won’t be a consistent feeling though, especially as the project scopes grow beyond just a couple music notes
