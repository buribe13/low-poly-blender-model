                        picking up a new (but really old) software in 2025 always feels taunting, especially when your laziness can't depend on an AI chat assistant to guide you through the difficulties of a new UI environment. I've known of Blender for years now. From a distance, it was always something that I would just lend my respect towards, even more so to the souls that could decipher it’s uses. For this training-wheels period, I took on modeling music notes from the circle of fifths chart that lives pasted at the top of my workspace in the living room of my KTown kingdom.

                        Ideation was simple. I make music and do all my design projects from the same standings desk, so I tend to mix the two mediums at any given opportunity. Truthfully, I felt like at this point in my 3d career, music notes wouldn’t have me pulling my hair out– a sight my lovely roommates wouldn’t want to see. I present the beauty of a half note, a quarter note, and an eighth note.

                        To construct this masterpiece, I relied heavily on the use of UV spheres and a single square, for the eighth note’s flag. After making the quarter note first to establish a template, i was able to have a foundation for the rest of the notes construction– even hollowing out the center of the half note!

                        To be honest, the joy in coloring, adding light, and the floor/background provided me enough pleasure to want to come back to this software. Usually with things like this, i try to look for specs of satisfaction that i can strive to fulfill on each go – i’m fully aware this won’t be a consistent feeling though, especially as the project scopes grow beyond just a couple music notes

                        interfaces are my comfort – when the process began of experimenting with interface in blender, i knew there was an opportunity for me to establish further comfort in the software. to reiterate, i couldn't be more of a newbie to 3d modeling, it scares me…for this assignment though, i entered the world of a design freelancer, locked in their studio dungeon – often times in the dark – and the brief set up that allows them dissociate from the real world. haha, just jokes, mostly at myself.

                        notion is a tool that i've used since early undergrad despite the many frustrations that i've developed with it. it's not because its a bad experience, i just crave more! with this interface, i wanted a freelancer, a designer perhaps, to have the opportunity to engage with a client who is new to notion, and allow them to communicate seamlessly on their collaborative efforts using a variety of visual indicators. of course, i'd be building within notion's popular database system.

                        as per the assignment guidelines, i started with the room that this interface would be built in – the desk, the chairs, the speakers, the laptop, the monitors– all the basics which every async worker tends to have. in comparison to last week where i was just getting a feel for things, i was able to experiment more with materials, colors, and textures to replicate my own work-space – the place i write this blog post from.

                        in looking at my renders, i definitely would like to learn more about lighting and creating an outside world from within. to add, the windows that you see in my scene (yes, those are windows -__-) don't really have a depth or view to anything beyond the endless canvas. i'd either like to add an image or create some assets to make the room feel more accurate to how it really is.

                        in terms of third party resources, i did use blenderkit to source the accurate tech that i needed for my scene – i felt like my skills at this point wouldn't have allowed me to accurately replicate the materials i use on the day to day, so i decided this route worked best. all in all, i look forward to adding the actual interface to my environment soon!

                    <p>
                        This sentence is set up by the prior one, which describes how limiting it is to define design and just the style of the page, a particularly interesting token that all UX institutions think about all day. With digital interfaces – the ones built with code – so much in psychology is required to activate the terms "good design" in regards to an app or website. The google search field, which is basic aesthetic, powers billions of searches a day – tell me how that isn't good?
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>

                    <p>
                        In the era of vibe-code, a quote like this is far less daunting than it once was. The ever consuming nature of programming, in my brain at least, resembles that of the world and inevitably a creator.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Imagine a small village in Japan with its muted, desaturated colors, and compare this to a place like Mexico, where houses are painted in very pure, saturated colors. These colors reflect the culture around them, and you should consider your content in the same way: Does it demand lively colors or a subdued, modernist scheme? The saturation of your colors is the key to this."</p>

                    <p>
                        After many years of seeing the "Mexican filter" convos on twitter, it's great to see cultures like my own contextualized more properly and how color plays a role in the richness of it. My favorite part of traveling is actually the color inspo I pick up from regions who practice different traditions or combinations!

                    <p>
                        I am the biggest culprit here – as someone who tends to lollygag around the low to mid-fi stages of prototyping, I'd be lying if I said it was out of intention. Thinking about why these stages exist in the design process is crucial to successfully meeting the goal at hand.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Finished-looking (or -behaving) prototypes are often thought to indicate that the design they represent is near completion… It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design."</p>

                    <p>
                        Aesthetic achievement isn't a guarantee in digital products! Actions can be misleading, the flow can be out of sorts – a whole list of boxes need to be checked from the users side before solidity can be confirmed.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"It was more efficient to wait on the results of independent investigations in the key areas of role, look and feel, and implementation than to try to build a monolithic prototype that integrated all features from the start."</p>

                    <h3>Problem: Finding Space in a Dynamic Pool</h3>

                    <p>
                        One of the most interesting challenges in this project was implementing the logic for dropping an album back into the pool and having it naturally find space among the other albums through gravity and physics-based interactions. The initial approach attempted to pre-calculate a target position by selecting a random slot among evenly-spaced album positions. However, this deterministic approach failed because it didn't account for the dynamic, non-uniform arrangement of albums that had already been dropped and settled. The solution was to abandon pre-calculated positioning entirely and instead implement a physics-based system where the falling album naturally finds its place through gravitational forces, collision detection, and reactive interactions with existing albums.
                    </p>


                    <div class="image-block">
                        <a href="https://buribe13.github.io/pattern-rhythm-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            <img src="take-5/final-result-3.png" alt="final result">
                        </a>
                        <p class="image-caption">final result, click image to see project -></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The system works through a multi-layered physics simulation. Gravity is applied continuously, and the album's position updates each frame based on its velocity. When the album reaches the bottom boundary, it bounces with energy damping, gradually losing momentum until it settles. The critical innovation is the collision detection loop that checks the falling album against every other album in the pool. When a collision is detected, the system calculates the overlap distance and collision angle, then separates the albums by pushing them apart along the collision normal. The falling album's velocity is reflected using a dot product calculation, creating realistic bouncing behavior. Simultaneously, existing albums reactively push away from the falling album when it gets within a reaction distance, creating space proactively rather than waiting for collisions. This dual approach, reactive pushing and collision-based bouncing, ensures the falling album naturally carves out space in the pool. The album settles when its total velocity drops below a threshold and it's resting on the bottom, at which point its final position is preserved, allowing the pool to maintain its organic, physics-driven arrangement rather than forcing a uniform grid layout.
