                        picking up a new (but really old) software in 2025 always feels taunting, especially when your laziness can't depend on an AI chat assistant to guide you through the difficulties of a new UI environment. I've known of Blender for years now. From a distance, it was always something that I would just lend my respect towards, even more so to the souls that could decipher it’s uses. For this training-wheels period, I took on modeling music notes from the circle of fifths chart that lives pasted at the top of my workspace in the living room of my KTown kingdom.

                        Ideation was simple. I make music and do all my design projects from the same standings desk, so I tend to mix the two mediums at any given opportunity. Truthfully, I felt like at this point in my 3d career, music notes wouldn’t have me pulling my hair out– a sight my lovely roommates wouldn’t want to see. I present the beauty of a half note, a quarter note, and an eighth note.

                        <!-- space for your writing -->
                        To construct this masterpiece, I relied heavily on the use of UV spheres and a single square, for the eighth note’s flag. After making the quarter note first to establish a template, i was able to have a foundation for the rest of the notes construction– even hollowing out the center of the half note!

                        To be honest, the joy in coloring, adding light, and the floor/background provided me enough pleasure to want to come back to this software. Usually with things like this, i try to look for specs of satisfaction that i can strive to fulfill on each go – i’m fully aware this won’t be a consistent feeling though, especially as the project scopes grow beyond just a couple music notes

                        interfaces are my comfort – when the process began of experimenting with interface in blender, i knew there was an opportunity for me to establish further comfort in the software. to reiterate, i couldn't be more of a newbie to 3d modeling, it scares me…for this assignment though, i entered the world of a design freelancer, locked in their studio dungeon – often times in the dark – and the brief set up that allows them dissociate from the real world. haha, just jokes, mostly at myself.

                        notion is a tool that i've used since early undergrad despite the many frustrations that i've developed with it. it's not because its a bad experience, i just crave more! with this interface, i wanted a freelancer, a designer perhaps, to have the opportunity to engage with a client who is new to notion, and allow them to communicate seamlessly on their collaborative efforts using a variety of visual indicators. of course, i'd be building within notion's popular database system.

                    <p>
                        as per the assignment guidelines, i started with the room that this interface would be built in – the desk, the chairs, the speakers, the laptop, the monitors– all the basics which every async worker tends to have. in comparison to last week where i was just getting a feel for things, i was able to experiment more with materials, colors, and textures to replicate my own work-space – the place i write this blog post from.

                        in looking at my renders, i definitely would like to learn more about lighting and creating an outside world from within. to add, the windows that you see in my scene (yes, those are windows -__-) don't really have a depth or view to anything beyond the endless canvas. i'd either like to add an image or create some assets to make the room feel more accurate to how it really is.

                    <p>
                        in terms of third party resources, i did use blenderkit to source the accurate tech that i needed for my scene – i felt like my skills at this point wouldn't have allowed me to accurately replicate the materials i use on the day to day, so i decided this route worked best. all in all, i look forward to adding the actual interface to my environment soon!
